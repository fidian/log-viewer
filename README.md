# Log Viewer

This is a simple way to view logs in a browser. By pointing the script at a series of paths or globs, you are able to then serve these files to your browser. When you load the page, the logs are searchable and a history is kept when toggling between different files.

This is a quick and easy method to allow people to view logs without granting them the permission to execute commands on a server.
